      <h4>Groups</h4>
      <p>
        In order to use this app, you must be a member of at least one group. If
        you received a group join code, click the Join Group button. Enter the
        group code, as well as your display name for the group. You can have a
        different display name for each group you are in.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to create a new group, click the Create New Group button.
        Enter the group name, as well as your display name for the group. After
        saving, the group join code will be generated and displayed. Share this
        code with people you want to invite to the group. You will automatically
        be made an admin for any group you create.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can manage all groups for which you are a group admin by clicking
        the Manage Groups button. From here, you can change the group name, or
        make it inactive. Inactive groups won't show up in the Select Group
        drowndown list on the groups page.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Members</h4>
      <p>
        Group members can click on their own name in the members list to update
        their display name and email address for the group. By default, when
        joining or creating a group, your email address is set to your login
        email address. However, this can be updated individually for each group
        without affecting your login email address.
      </p>
      <p>
        Group admins can edit all group members, change their active status, and
        give or remove admin rights to other members. An admin may not remove
        their own admin rights - another admin must peform that update.
      </p>
      <p>
        Group members can only be deleted if they don't have any expenses/splits
        assigned to them. Group members who are made inactive will no longer
        show up in the dropdown list when creating a new expense.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Categories</h4>
      <p>A group admin must create categories before adding expenses.</p>
      <p>
        Categories can only be deleted if they don't have any expenses/splits
        assigned to them. Categories that are made inactive will no longer show
        up in the dropdown list when creating a new expense. Only group admins
        can edit or delete categories, or change their active status.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your group does not have any need for categorizing expenses, you can
        create a default category for all expenses. As long as your group only
        has one category, it will be selected automatically for you when you
        create a new expense.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Expenses</h4>
      <p>
        By default, the expenses tab shows all unpaid expenses. You can use the
        filter dropdowns to filter expenses by payee, category, or both. You can
        also toggle off Unpaid only to view all expenses. Clicking the Date
        header will toggle sorting the table in ascending or descending date
        order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the expand arrow on any row to view the split detail for that
        expense. You can click the paid icon on a split row to mark that
        specific split paid or unpaid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the Add New Expense button to create a new expense for the group.
        The Evenly Shared Amount field is for the portion of the expense that
        should be split evenly amoung all members. The Proportional Amount field
        is for items like tax and tip that should be split proportional to the
        amount each member is responsible for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the Add New Split button to add a single split line to the
        expense. You can select the member and enter an amount in the Member
        Amount field that the member is individually responsible for and should
        not be split. Click the Add All Members button to automatically insert a
        split line for each active group member not already listed in the splits
        table.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the Allocate Expense button to allocate the shared and
        proportional amounts to all members in the splits section. If you have
        left the evenly shared amount blank, the form will calculate the amount
        remaining in the total that has not been entered on the splits and
        allocate it evenly. If you have an expense that should simply be split
        evenly among all group members, after entering the Total Amount,
        Description, and Category, simply click Add All Members then click
        Allocate Expense.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline">
        You must click Allocate Expense before you can save the expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The form also allows you to upload a supporting receipt for the expense.
        The receipt must be a PDF or an image file, with a maximum size of 5MB.
        Click the Upload receipt button, then select your file. The receipt will
        be saved with the expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on the expense row to edit the expense details. Please note that
        editing an expense will mark all splits unpaid. When viewing an existing
        expense, you can view the receipt, if one exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your group has a regularly reccuring expense, you can choose to
        memorize the expense on the add expense screeen. You can then find the
        expense on the Memorized tab (see further instructions in the next
        section).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Memorized Expenses</h4>
      <p>
        After creating a memorized expense (see the previous section), you can
        view it on this tab. Clicking the memorized expense row will let you
        edit or delete the memorized expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking the + on the memorized expense row will create a new expense
        based on the memorized expense. Please note that the expense date is not
        saved with the memorized expense, so make sure you set the correct
        expense date for the actual expense.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Select a group member from the dropdown list to view the total amount
        owed by that member to the other group members, and to that member from
        the other group members. If you wish to see a summary of expenses for a
        specific date range, you can enter the start date, end date, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
        After selecting a group member and optionally entering filter dates, if
        any outstanding expenses are found, you can click on a row in the table
        to see the category breakdown of the expenses owed between the two
        members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click the paid icon on any row to mark all splits owed between those two
        group members as paid. Please note this action can only be undone by
        viewing the expenses on the expenses tab and clicking the paid icon one
        split at a time. Please be sure that you have paid/are ready to pay
        before clicking the paid icon.
