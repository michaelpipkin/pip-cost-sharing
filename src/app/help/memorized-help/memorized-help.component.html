        After creating a memorized expense (see the expenses tab), you can view it on this tab. Clicking the memorized
        expense row will let you edit or delete the memorized expense.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking the + on the memorized expense row will create a new expense based on the memorized expense. Please
        note that the expense date is not saved with the memorized expense, so make sure you set the correct
        expense date for the actual expense.
