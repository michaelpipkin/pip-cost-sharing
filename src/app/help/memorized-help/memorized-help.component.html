    <h4 class="mt-2">This tab is used to manage memorized expenses</h4>
    <p>
        After creating a memorized expense, you can view it on this tab. Clicking the memorized expense row will
        let you edit or delete the memorized expense.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking the + on the memorized expense row will create a new expense based on the memorized expense. Please
        note that the expense date is not saved with the memorized expense, so make sure you set the correct
        expense date for the actual expense.
