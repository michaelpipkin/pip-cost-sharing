<h4 class="mt-2">This tab is used to manage group expenses</h4>
<p>
    By default, the expenses tab shows all unpaid expenses. You can use the filter dropdowns to filter
    expenses by payee, category, or both. You can also turn off the toggle to view unpaid expenses
    only to view all expenses. Clicking the Date header will toggle sorting the table in ascending
    or descending date order.
</p>
<p>
    Click the expand arrow on any row to view the split detail for that expense. You can click the paid
    icon on a split row to mark that specific split paid or unpaid.
</p>
<p>
    Click the Add New Expense button to create a new expense for the group. The Evenly Shared Amount field
    is for the portion of the expense that should be split evenly amoung all members. The Proportional Amount
    field is for items like tax and tip that should be split proportional to the amount each member is
    responsible for.
</p>
<p>
    Click the Add New Split button to add a single split line to the expense. You can select the member and
    enter an amount in the Member Amount field that the member is individually responsible for and should not
    be split. Click the Add All Members button to automatically insert a split line for each active group member.
</p>
<p>
    Click the Allocate Expense button to allocate the shared and proportional amounts to all members in the
    splits section. If you have left the evenly shared amount blank, the form will calculate the amount
    remaining in the total that has not been entered on the splits and allocate it evenly. If you have an
    expense that should simply be split evenly among all group members, after entering the Total Amount,
    Description, and Category, simply click Add All Members then click Allocate Expense.
</p>
<p>
    The form also allows you to upload a supporting receipt for the expense. The receipt must be a PDF or an image
    file. Click the Upload receipt button, then select your file. The receipt will be saved with the expense.
</p>
<p>
    Click on the expense row to edit the expense details. Please note that editing an expense will mark all splits
    unpaid. When viewing an existing expense, you can view the receipt, if one exists.
