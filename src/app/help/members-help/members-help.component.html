        Group members can click on their own name in the members list to update their display name and email
        address for the group. By default, when joining or creating a group, your email address is set to your
        login email address. However, this can be updated individually for each group without affecting
        your login email address.
    </p>
    <p>
        Group admins can edit all group members, change their active status, and give or remove admin rights
        to other members. An admin may not remove their own admin rights - another admin must peform that update.
    </p>
    <p>
        Group members can only be deleted if they don't have any expenses/splits assigned to them. Group members
        who are made inactive will no longer show up in the dropdown list when creating a new expense.
