    <p>
        Group members must create categories before adding expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Categories can only be deleted if they don't have any expenses/splits assigned to them. Categories
        that are made inactive will no longer show up in the dropdown list when creating a new expense.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your group does not have any need for categoizing expenses, you can create a default category for
        all expenses.
