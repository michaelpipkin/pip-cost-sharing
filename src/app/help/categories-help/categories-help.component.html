        A group admin must create categories before adding expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Categories can only be deleted if they don't have any expenses/splits assigned to them. Categories
        that are made inactive will no longer show up in the dropdown list when creating a new expense. Only
        group admins can edit or delete categories, or change their active status.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your group does not have any need for categorizing expenses, you can create a default category for
        all expenses. As long as your group only has one category, it will be selected automatically for you
        when you create a new expense.
