    Group members can click on their own name in the members list to update
    their display name and email address for the group. By default, when joining
    or creating a group, your email address is set to your login email address.
    However, this can be updated individually for each group without affecting
    your login email address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group admins can add placeholder members by clicking the Add Member button.
    Enter the display name and email address for the new member. If someone
    registers for the app with the same email address and then joins the group,
    the placeholder member will be automatically replaced with the new member.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group admins can edit all group members, change their active status, and
    give or remove admin rights to other members. An admin may not remove their
    own admin rights - another admin must peform that update.
  </p>
  <p>
    Group members can only be removed if they don't have any expenses/splits
    assigned to them. Group members who are made inactive will no longer show up
    in the dropdown list when creating a new expense.
