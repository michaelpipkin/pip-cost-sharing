    Select a group member from the dropdown list to view the total amount owed
    by that member to the other group members, and to that member from the other
    group members. If you wish to see a summary of expenses for a specific date
    range, you can enter the start date, end date, or both.
  </p>
  <p>
    After selecting a group member and optionally entering filter dates, if any
    outstanding expenses are found, you can click on a row in the table to see
    the category breakdown of the expenses owed between the two members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click the paid icon on any row to pay all splits owed between those two
    group members. If you've added your various payment service handles on the
    account page, those services and your handles will appear in the payment
    dialog, so the payer knows how to send payment. Once payment is completed,
    click submit to mark the expenses as paid. Please note this action can only
    be undone by viewing the expenses on the expenses page and clicking the paid
    icon one split at a time. Marking expenses paid in this way will create a
    history record of the payment with the amount broken down by category. The
    history of payments can be viewed on the history page.
