    If your group has a regularly reccuring expense, you can create a memorized
    expense on this page. Memorizing an expense saves most of the expense
    details, allowing you to quickly and easily create a new expense based on
    the memorized expense.
  </p>
  <p>
    After creating a memorized expense, it will appear in the table. Clicking a
    row in the table will let you edit or delete the memorized expense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clicking the + on the memorized expense row will create a new expense based
    on the memorized expense.
