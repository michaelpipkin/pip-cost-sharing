  <p>Enter or edit a memorized expense with this form.</p>
  <p>
    The Proportional Amount field is for items like tax and tip that should be
    split proportional to the amount for which each member is responsible. The
    evenly shared remainder and the allocated split amount for each member will
    update automatically as you enter/update the total amount, proportional
    amount, and individual member amounts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click the Add New Split button to add a single split line to the expense.
    You can select the member and enter an amount in the Member Amount field
    that the member is individually responsible for and should not be split.
    Click the Add All Members button to automatically insert a split line for
    each active group member not already listed in the splits table. The form
    will automatically update the allocated amounts for each member as you
    change the total amount, proportional amount, or individual amounts for each
    member.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can perform basic arithmetic directly in any amount input field, if
    needed. (i.e. entering 3*6-2 in the total amount field will evaluate to
    16.00)
