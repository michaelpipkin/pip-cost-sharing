  <p>Enter or edit expense details with this form.</p>
  <p>
    With your cursor in the date field, you can use the + and - keys to adjust
    the date up and down by one day. Hitting 't' will set the date to today, 'm'
    or 'y' will set the date to the first day of the month or year of the date
    currently in the field, respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Proportional Amount field is for items like tax and tip that should be
    split proportional to the amount for which each member is responsible. The
    evenly shared remainder and the allocated split amount for each member will
    update automatically as you enter/update the total amount, proportional
    amount, and individual member amounts. The proportional amount is only
    available when splitting by amount, not percentage.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click the Add New Split button to add a single split line to the expense. By
    default, an expense is split evenly between all listed members. Click the
    Split by button to alternate between splitting the expense by dollar amount
    or by percentage.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are splitting by amount, you can enter the amount in the Member
    Amount field that the member is individually responsible for and should not
    be split. Click the Add All Members button to automatically insert a split
    line for each active group member not already listed in the splits table.
    The form will automatically update the allocated amounts for each member as
    you change the total amount, proportional amount, or individual amounts for
    each member.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are splitting by percentage, the form will automatically adjust the
    final member's percentage so that the total will always be 100%.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can perform basic arithmetic directly in any amount input field, but not
    percentage fields. (i.e. entering 3*6-2 in the total amount field will
    evaluate to 16.00)
  </p>
  <p>
    The form also allows you to upload a supporting receipt for the expense. The
    receipt must be a PDF or an image file, with a maximum size of 5MB. Click
    the Upload receipt button, then select your file. The receipt will be saved
    with the expense.
