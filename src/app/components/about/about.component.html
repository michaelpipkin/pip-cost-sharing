        Hi there! My name is Michael Pipkin, and I am the solo developer behind
        PipSplit.
      </p>

      <p data-testid="purpose-text">
        I created this site because I wanted an easy way to split monthly
        expenses with my housemate. From there, it grew into a fully-functional
        expense-sharing app. My goal is to offer a fast, reliable, and
        user-friendly tool for people who need to split costs among friends,
        roommates, or any group situation where shared expenses arise.

        PipSplit helps you effortlessly track and split shared expenses with
        unlimited groups. Whether you're splitting costs for a weekend getaway
        with friends, tracking monthly expenses with roommates, or calculating
        everyone's share of a dinner out, PipSplit makes it simple and
        transparent. There's even an option to split an expense without creating
        an account!
