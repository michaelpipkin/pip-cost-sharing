    A default category is automatically created when a new group is created. Any
    group admin can create additional categories.
  </p>
  <p>
    Categories can only be deleted if they don't have any expenses/splits
    assigned to them. Categories that are made inactive will no longer show up
    in the dropdown list when creating a new expense. Only group admins can edit
    or delete categories, or change their active status.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your group does not have any need for categorizing expenses, you can
    simply use the default category for all expenses. As long as your group only
    has one category, it will be selected automatically for you when you create
    a new expense.
