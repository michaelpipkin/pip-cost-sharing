    <h1>Privacy Policy for PipSplit</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to PipSplit. We respect your privacy and are committed to
      protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we
      collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our expense
      sharing application, available as both a web application and mobile app
      ("the App").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we
        collect your email address and password (encrypted).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Profile Information:</strong> If you sign in with Google, we
        receive your email address and basic profile information from Google.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Group and Expense Data:</strong> Information you enter including
        group names, member names (which may be nicknames or aliases), expense
        descriptions, amounts, and payment records.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you
        interact with the App through Firebase Analytics, including features
        used, pages visited, and time spent in the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect device type,
        operating system, browser type, and IP address. For mobile app users,
        this may include additional device identifiers used for analytics and
        advertising purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies and
        similar tracking technologies to improve your experience and for
        analytics purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> When using the mobile app, we
        may collect mobile advertising identifiers (such as Apple's IDFA or
        Google's Advertising ID) for advertising and analytics purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Mobile App Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      The mobile app may request the following permissions to provide enhanced functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera:</strong> If you choose to use the receipt scanning feature,
        we request access to your device's camera to capture photos of receipts.
        Photos are processed locally on your device and are not automatically uploaded
        or stored on our servers unless you explicitly choose to attach them to an expense.
        You can decline camera permission and still use all other features of the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photo Library / Storage:</strong> We request access to your device's
        photo library or storage to allow you to select and attach existing receipt images
        to expenses. We only access the specific photos you choose to upload. Selected
        photos are uploaded to our secure servers only when you explicitly attach them
        to an expense record. You can decline this permission and still use all other
        features of the app, including capturing new photos with the camera.
      </li>
    </ul>

      authentication protocols to protect your account.
