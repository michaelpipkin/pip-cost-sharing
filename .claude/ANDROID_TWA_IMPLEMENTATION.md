# Android TWA (Trusted Web Activity) Implementation Guide

## Overview
Converting PipSplit PWA to an Android app using Google's Trusted Web Activity (TWA) approach via Bubblewrap.

## Current Status
- ✅ PWA manifest.json exists and is well-configured
- ✅ App works perfectly as installed PWA on Android
- ✅ Icons available (192x192, 512x512)
- ✅ No service worker (online-only by design)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Optimize PWA Manifest (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Reviewed - manifest is good but could use minor enhancements

**Current manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "name": "PipSplit",
  "short_name": "PipSplit",
  "description": "Split expenses and track shared costs easily",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#4caf50",
  "icons": [...]
}
```

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Add `orientation` field for mobile optimization
- Add `categories` for Play Store classification
- Add `screenshots` for richer install prompt

### 2. Install Bubblewrap CLI (PENDING)
**What:** Bubblewrap is Google's official tool for generating TWAs

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (already installed via pnpm)
- JDK 17+ (required for Android builds)
- Android SDK (Bubblewrap can install if needed)

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g @bubblewrap/cli
```

**First-time setup:**
```bash
bubblewrap doctor
```
This will check dependencies and offer to install missing components.

### 3. Initialize TWA Project (PENDING)
**What:** Generate the Android project wrapper for your PWA

```bash
bubblewrap init --manifest https://pipsplit.com/manifest.json
```

**Interactive prompts will ask for:**
- App name: PipSplit
- Package name: com.pipsplit.app (or your preference)
- Host: pipsplit.com
- Start URL: /
- Icon URLs: Will pull from manifest
- Theme color: #4caf50 (from manifest)
- Background color: #ffffff (from manifest)
- Enable notifications: No (unless you want push notifications)
- Fallback strategy: Keep current page (recommended for online-only app)
- Display mode: standalone

**Output:** Creates a `twa-project` folder with Android project files

### 4. Configure Signing Keys (PENDING)
**What:** Create signing keys for Play Store deployment

**For development/testing (auto-generated):**
Bubblewrap creates a debug key automatically.

**For Play Store release:**
```bash
# Generate upload key
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

**Important:**
- Store keystore file securely (NOT in git)
- Save keystore password
- Save key alias and password
- You'll need these for every release

**Add to .gitignore:**
```
*.jks
*.keystore
key.properties
```

### 5. Build APK for Testing (PENDING)
**What:** Build a debug APK to test on your device

```bash
cd twa-project
bubblewrap build
```

**Output:** Generates `app-release-signed.apk`

**Test locally:**
- Install on Android device via ADB or file transfer
- Test all functionality
- Verify no browser chrome appears
- Test deep linking
- Verify icon and splash screen

### 6. Build AAB for Play Store (PENDING)
**What:** Generate Android App Bundle for Play Store submission

```bash
bubblewrap build --appBundle
```

**Output:** Generates `app-release-bundle.aab`

### 7. Play Store Submission Requirements (PENDING)
**What you'll need:**
- [x] Developer account ($25 one-time fee) - in progress
- [ ] App icon: 512x512 (you have this)
- [ ] Feature graphic: 1024x500
- [ ] Screenshots: 2-8 images (minimum 2)
  - Phone screenshots (16:9 or 9:16)
  - Tablet screenshots optional but recommended
- [ ] Privacy policy URL (required if app collects data)
- [ ] App description
- [ ] Content rating questionnaire
- [ ] Target audience

**Screenshot recommendations:**
- Show key features: expense creation, group management, summary view
- Use actual app screenshots from Android device
- Consider using Android device frames for professional look

## Configuration Files

### bubblewrap.config.json (Generated)
Located in `twa-project/` after initialization. Key fields:
```json
{
  "packageId": "com.pipsplit.app",
  "host": "pipsplit.com",
  "name": "PipSplit",
  "launcherName": "PipSplit",
  "display": "standalone",
  "themeColor": "#4caf50",
  "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
  "startUrl": "/",
  "iconUrl": "https://pipsplit.com/assets/images/pip_split_icon_512x512.png",
  "maskableIconUrl": "https://pipsplit.com/assets/images/pip_split_icon_512x512.png"
}
```

## Digital Asset Links (Critical)

**What:** Verifies you own both the website and Android app

**Required file:** `src/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

**Generated by Bubblewrap** but must be hosted at:
`https://pipsplit.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

**Example content:**
```json
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "com.pipsplit.app",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["AA:BB:CC:..."]
  }
}]
```

**Deployment:**
- Add `.well-known` folder to `src/`
- Update `angular.json` to include in assets
- Deploy to production
- Verify accessible at URL above

## Maintenance & Updates

**Good news:** Updates are automatic!
- When you update your web app, users get updates instantly
- No need to rebuild/resubmit APK for content changes
- Only rebuild if you change:
  - Package name
  - App icons
  - Splash screen
  - TWA configuration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App installs without errors
- [ ] No browser UI (address bar, etc.) visible
- [ ] App icon appears in launcher
- [ ] Splash screen displays on launch
- [ ] All Firebase features work (auth, Firestore)
- [ ] Deep links work correctly
- [ ] Back button behavior is appropriate
- [ ] Status bar color matches theme
- [ ] App appears in Android app settings
- [ ] App can be uninstalled properly

## Troubleshooting

### Digital Asset Links not verified
- Check assetlinks.json is accessible
- Verify SHA256 fingerprint matches keystore
- Allow 24-48 hours for Google to verify
- Use `adb logcat` to see verification errors

### App opens in Chrome browser instead of TWA
- Digital Asset Links not verified yet
- Wrong SHA256 fingerprint in assetlinks.json
- Package name mismatch

### Build failures
- Check JDK version (need 17+)
- Verify Android SDK installed
- Run `bubblewrap doctor` to diagnose

## COMPLETED STEPS

✅ **Prerequisites installed:**
- Node.js v22.12.0
- JDK 17 (via junction at C:\jdk17)
- Bubblewrap CLI v1.24.1

✅ **TWA Project created:**
- Location: `C:\Users\mpipk\source\repos\michaelpipkin\pipsplit-twa\`
- Package ID: `com.pipsplit.app`
- Keystore: `android.keystore` (password: android123 - **CHANGE FOR PRODUCTION**)

✅ **Build successful:**
- APK: `app-release-signed.apk`
- AAB: `app-release-bundle.aab`
- SHA256 Fingerprint: `F7:0A:30:A2:74:05:4B:6A:3E:AC:03:A3:F2:D3:2E:83:D2:36:C7:28:94:7C:06:DB:85:2F:E4:25:52:BC:FF:B3`

✅ **Digital Asset Links file created:**
- File: `src/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
- Angular.json updated to include .well-known folder
- **NEXT STEP: Deploy to production!**

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Build and deploy your web app:**
   ```bash
   cd pip-cost-sharing
   pnpm build:prod
   # Deploy to Firebase
   ```

2. **Verify assetlinks.json is accessible:**
   After deployment, check: `https://pipsplit.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

   It should return the JSON file with your package name and SHA256 fingerprint.

3. **Test the APK on your Android device:**
   - Transfer `app-release-signed.apk` to your phone
   - Install it (you may need to enable "Install from Unknown Sources")
   - Open the app
   - First time: May open in Chrome (Digital Asset Links not verified yet)
   - After 24-48 hours: Should open as full-screen app (once Google verifies)

4. **Upload AAB to Play Store Console:**
   - Go to Google Play Console
   - Create new app
   - Upload `app-release-bundle.aab`
   - Fill out store listing
   - Submit for review

## IMPORTANT: Production Keystore

⚠️ **The current keystore uses a simple password (android123) for testing!**

Before final Play Store submission, you should:
1. Create a new production keystore with a strong password (alphanumeric only, no special chars)
2. Update `twa-manifest.json` with new keystore path
3. Rebuild the AAB
4. Get new SHA256 fingerprint
5. Update `assetlinks.json` with new fingerprint
6. Redeploy website

**Production keystore creation:**
```bash
cd pipsplit-twa
C:\jdk17\bin\keytool.exe -genkey -v -keystore production.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
# Use strong password with only letters/numbers/basic chars
```

## Next Steps After Play Store Approval

1. **Add Play Store badge to website:**
   ```html
   <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pipsplit.app">
     <img src="google-play-badge.png" alt="Get it on Google Play">
   </a>
   ```

2. **Consider iOS PWA:**
   - iOS doesn't have TWA equivalent
   - Users can still "Add to Home Screen"
   - Or explore Capacitor for iOS App Store distribution

3. **Monitor Play Store Console:**
   - Check crash reports
   - Monitor user reviews
   - Track installation analytics

## Estimated Timeline

- **Setup & Configuration:** 2-3 hours
- **Testing & Refinement:** 2-4 hours
- **Play Store Submission:** 1-2 hours
- **Google Review Process:** 1-7 days (typically 1-3 days)
